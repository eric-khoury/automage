Automage
========

What is Automage?
-----------------
Automage is a lightweight alternative to lightbox.
The goal is to keep it free from configuration, while providing a tasty way of showing images on a website.

Are there any dependencies?
---------------------------
Yesh. It's built with jQuery 1.7.1. You'll need that for it to work.

So how do I use it?
-------------------
Just include it.
    <script src="automage.js"></script>

So how does it work?
--------------------------
It will look for `<a href="path/to/image"> <img src="path/to/thumbnail" alt="" /> </a>` and display `path/to/image` as a layer above everything else instead of taking you to the image itself.
